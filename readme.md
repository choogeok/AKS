# Designing a Scalable Kubernetes Solution to host a Company’s Website

Construct a prototype Kubernetes cluster using ​Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to showcase the idea. 

Requirements: 
Kubernetes cluster consisting of 2 nodes and take nginx as an example workload running in the cluster. 
Allow the nginx website to be accessible from the Internet
Expand the Kubernetes Cluster to 3 nodes
Scales the pods from 2 to 10 units

The repo includes media files that are created during a project for Azure learning.
1) Create an AKS cluster
2) Verify the status of nodes in AKS cluster
3) Deploy Nginx using image from DockerHub. Verify the pod deployed in AKS cluster. Identify the state of deployment
4) Allow the website to be accessible from the Browser
5) Expand the Kubernetes Cluster
6) Scales the pods from 2 to 10 units and display Pod distribution across cluster nodes
