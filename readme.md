Kubernetes cluster consisting of 2 nodes and take nginx as an example workload running in the cluster. 
Allow the nginx website to be accessible from the Internet
Expand the Kubernetes Cluster to 3 nodes
Scales the pods from 2 to 10 units

The repo includes media files
1) Create an AKS cluster
2) Verify the status of nodes in AKS cluster
3) Deploy Nginx using image from DockerHub4. Verify the pod deployed in AKS cluster. Identify the state of deployment
4) Allow the website to be accessible from the Browser
5) Expand the Kubernetes Cluster
6) Scales the pods from 2 to 10 units and display Pod distribution across cluster nodes
